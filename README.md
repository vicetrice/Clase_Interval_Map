# Clase_Interval_Map
interval_map<K,V> is a data structure that associates keys of type K with values of type V. It is designed to be used efficiently in situations where intervals of consecutive keys are associated with the same value. Your task is to implement the assign member function of this data structure, which is outlined below.

interval_map<K, V> is implemented on top of std::map. For more information on std::map, you may refer to `cppreference.com`.

Each key-value-pair (k,v) in interval_map<K,V>::m_map means that the value v is associated with all keys from k (including) to the next key (excluding) in m_map. The member interval_map<K,V>::m_valBegin holds the value that is associated with all keys less than the first key in m_map.

Example: Let M be an instance of interval_map<int,char> where

M.m_valBegin=='A',
M.m_map=={ (1,'B'), (3,'A') },
Then M represents the mapping

...

-2 -> 'A'

-1 -> 'A'

0 -> 'A'

1 -> 'B'

2 -> 'B'

3 -> 'A'

4 -> 'A'

5 -> 'A'
